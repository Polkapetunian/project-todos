# Project Todos

This is a to do app, made with React and Redux. 

## The problem

I got inspiration from teacher-led code sessions, Stack Overflow and some other articles I found on the web. I wanted a clean but also recognisable design so I created a simple logo for the app ToDo. 

I used Styled components for the styling and Day JS to display dates and times.
